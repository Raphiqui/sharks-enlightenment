This behavior brings them into more contact with humans than most species of sharks, and they are therefore responsible for fatally biting more people than any other species.",

Officiellement, le plus grand spécimen pêché et reconnu par les scientifiques mesurait 6,40 m et pesait 3 220 kg. Il possède un museau conique assez long. Ses dents, tranchantes comme des lames de rasoir, sont plates, triangulaires et dentelées et peuvent mesurer sept centimètres de long dont six centimètres dépassent des gencives. Sa mâchoire impressionnante comporte entre quatre et six rangées de dents dont seules les deux premières sont fonctionnelles. Quand il lui arrive de perdre une dent, une autre de la rangée arrière vient prendre sa place. La mâchoire de ce requin est dotée entre quarante-quatre à cinquante deux dents. Si les fentes branchiales sont très longues, elles n'encerclent pas totalement la tête. Ces branchies précèdent les nageoires pectorales de forme falciforme et bien développée. La nageoire caudale est courte, presque symétrique en forme de croissant. Super-prédateur des océans, le requin blanc a néanmoins son point faible. En effet, pour survivre, il doit être en mouvement constant afin de pouvoir s'oxygéner en permanence.",
